Add the following file to .vscode/launch.json

{
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "configurations": [
    {
      "name": "Run Django",
      "type": "python",
      "request": "attach",
      "pathMappings": [
        {
          "localRoot": "/Users/dragon/dxw/nhs-ei.website",
          "remoteRoot": "/app"
        }
      ],
      "port": 3000,
      "host": "127.0.0.1",
    }
  ]
}

-------

Start a server via script/server then connect to it by clicking the Debug button
(left ribbon with a bug on play) and the green arrow next to Run Django.
Errors about not connecting to port 3000 probably mean that the server isn't running.
