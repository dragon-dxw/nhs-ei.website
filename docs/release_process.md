# Release process

## Staging

1. Open a pull request back into the `main` branch with your changes, including an entry into the `CHANGELOG` under the Unreleased heading
1. Get that pull request code reviewed and approved
1. Check that any prerequisite changes to things like environment variables or third-party service configuration is ready
1. Merge the pull request

The changes are deployed automatically to staging. On merge, a docker image is built with Github actions and pushed to
the Azure container repository. The container is then deployed with Helm. See [deployment/README.md]()

Changes deployed to staging are still regarded as Unreleased in the changelog. Changes are not "released" until they are
deployed to production

# Database dumps

You can make a database dump with `script/dumpdb` which will put a JSON dump of most of the database into `/tmp/dumpdb.json`.
This can then be imported with `script/manpy loaddata dumpdb.json` (or `python manage.py` if in the container)
